## Day 8

## SPENT ABOUT 2 HOURS ON AI


** 1. ** USED BARD , MONICA , CHATGPT , OTHER MINI CHATBOT AND FINALLY USED BING.

THE RESULT WHAT I EXPECTED CAME ONLY FROM MICROSOFT BING AND ALL OTHERS COULD'NT PRODUCE THE PROPER RESULT ,, THEY WHERE GETTING CONFUSED...

#**I GAVE THE LIST OF ALL THE NAMES OF STUDENTS IN MY CLASS .
LATER I GAVE THE LIST OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE DONE THE CONNECT SESSION 
NEXT I GAVE THE LIST OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED THE CONNECT SESSION TOPICS 
THE RESULT NEEDED WAS SIMPLE .. THE LIST OF STUDENT WHO HAVE NOT DONE NOR ASSIGNED ANY TOPIC 
WHAT SO MANY VARIETIES OF PROMPTS THERE WHERE DOING MISTAKES**#

CHATGPT ANSWER : I GAVE THE LIST OF 70 NAMES IT IS SHOWING U ENTERED THE DATA OF 62 STUDENTS 
AFTER MULTIPLE TRIES , CHANGING THE STYLE , SENDING WITH NUMBERS ETC FAILED TO ANSWER
LATER , I ASKED IT TO TYPE NAMES OF THE STUDENTS WITH ROLL NUMBER NOW IT GAVE THE RESULT PERFECT 70 STUDENTS BUT LATER AGAIN GOT CONFUSED SEGREGATING THE ANSWER .

MONICA ANSWER : BETTER THE GPT UNDERSTOOD THE QN BUT LATER IN THE LAST IT STARTED TO MIX UP THE NAMES OF STUDENTS FOR WHOM TOPICS ARE ASSIGNED . WITH MULTIPLE TRIAL AND ERROR ,, IT SUCCESSES TO ANSWER.  BUT TOOK A LOT OF TIME TO MAKE IT UNDERSTAND 

BARD ANSWER : TRUSTING IN IT I DIVED SAME LIKE MONICA IT STARTED TO MIX UP NAMES , GET CONFUSED . GOOD THING IS IT USED SHEETS TO DO OTHER THEN GPT WHICH USE PYTHON CODE ... THE ANSWER WAS CLOSE BUT NOT SATISFACTORY ....

OTHER MINI CHATBOT ANSWER : THEY WHERE OUT OF BOX .. DID'NT EVEN REMEMBERED THE LAST DATA NEATLY 

THERE COMES OUR SAVIOR ;
MICROSOFT BING : THE ANSWER WAS PERFECT , IN A SINGLE PROMPT IT LAYED DOWN THE RESULT WITHOUT ANY ERROR OR COMPLICATIONS
I GOT THE RIGHT RESULT 

LEARNT :: 1. ALWAYS FRAME PROMPTS IN A STYLE --> THE RESPECTIVE AI WORKS LIKE ROLL NUMBER DID'NT WORK FOR GPT BUT WORKED FOR BARD...
2.DON'T WRITE A BIG LONG PROMPT , TYPE IN PROMPT 1 BY 1 IT WILL REDUCE THE CONFUSION , LIKE 1.LIST OF STUDENTS 2. NAMES OF WHO FINISHED THE CONNECT SESSION 3.NAMES OF STUDENTS WHO ASSIGNED TOPICS 4. NOW ASK SEPARATELY THE LIST OF NOT ASSIGNED NOR FIXED
